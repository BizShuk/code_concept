### 2016.12.03
Day 1 ,starting to work on this project for practicing. I feel little bit annoyed. First time to take seriously on nodejs with express and.... plus ReactJS. Syntax tricks always bother me most in some ways.

1. test basic http protocal with express.js
2. think about general db lib
3. build default.css and default.js for long-term purpose
4. config domain with slURL.shuk.info and l.shuk.info
5. redirect above domain to express.js server with nginx upstream
6. integrate with webpack and ReactJS

Tomorrow , LeeCode get another context on the morning. Another two hours are expected to spend.
