apache setting /etc/apache2

Apache Doc Root	/var/www 


[Command]
	sudo service apache2 [start|stop|restart|reload|graceful]
	sudo a2[en|dis]site [site in site-availble]
	sudo a2[en|dis]mod [mod in mods-availble]

[apache2.conf]

	將web root 改到 home/shuk下面
	/etc/apache2/sites_enabled/000-default , Document

	conf.d/charset
	移除AddDefaultCharset UTF-8的註解



問題處理:

	1.Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
		只要在 httpd.conf 或是 apache2.conf 裡面加上 "ServerName 127.0.0.1"

	2.

Options的參數說明可參考官網說明，只是說明中的yosia也不太會翻譯，不過基本上從設定值來說，這個參數是用來控制在目錄中可以執行的功能。共有以下幾個參數

All
除了MultiViews以外的所有功能
ExecCGI
可以使用mod_cgi來執行CGI程式
FollowLinks
允許訪問符號連結(symbolic link)的子目錄。此為預設值。
Includes
允許mod_include所使用的伺服端函式庫
IncludesNOEXEC
同上，但#exec cmd 以及 #exec cgi除外
Indexes
若被訪問的URL中沒有任何的index檔案，則顯示該目錄的子目錄列表
MultiViews
多語系支援
SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
同FollowLinks,但目的地目錄或檔案的擁有者必須與符號連結的擁有者相同。


Example 1: Redirect and keep everything after the URL
The first option will show all of the same content on one URL as you would another. For example, if you just changed your domain to DomainB.com, but you still have plenty of visitors coming to DomainA.com, you would use this to show them all of the existing content that is located on the new domain, without the need to update both websites.

To do this, you would modify your .htaccess file for the domain that your users will go to, and insert these lines of code:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^DomainA.com
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://DomainB.com/$1 [P]

If you are using the file manager in cPanel, be sure that you have the option to show hidden files selected.

What does the above redirect do?
After adding this line into your .htaccess file, you will be able to go to DomainA.com/YourPage and it will show the content from DomainB.com/YourPage

Example 2: Redirect a domain to a specific url
There is another way you can do your redirect to show a specific URL, but keep the domain the same as well. If you want visitors to go to DomainA.com with a specific page in mind when doing so, you may use this code:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^DomainA.com
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://DomainB.com/PathToPageHere [P]

You would use this method if, for example, you had an external blog such as one on blogspot.com or maybe a shopping cart on etsy.com that you want people to visit your domain without fully hosting the domain there. Now, visitors can access your site using your domain, but see the content of an external URL.

Example 3 Re-directing an IP address
Occasionally, there will be a request to re-direct an IP address to a specific URL. The following code shows how this can be done in the .htaccess file.

# Redirect all IP address (replace the ## with the IP address numerals) to same http://domain_name.com
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^##\.##\.##\.##
RewriteRule (.*) http://domain_name.com/$1 [R=301,L]
Stipulations / Please read
Warning: If using the first option, search engines such as Google or Bing will see multiple sites with the same content and can cause ranking drops in one, or both of the sites. From an SEO standpoint, your best option is to create 301 redirects instead.

If you opt for the second option, and are using absolute links on your site (meaning your links go to the full URL and not just an individual file) any links will go to the original site that is associated with that link.
