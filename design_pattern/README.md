# Design Pattern

### js
- curry , simular closure callback function [HERE](curry.js)



# Module
protect private property in encapsulation.
```
(function(){})()
```


# prototype


# Observer
Many developers choose to aggregate the publish/subscribe design pattern with the observer though there is a distinction. Subscribers in the publish/subscribe pattern are notified through some messaging medium, but observers are notified by implementing a handler similar to the subject.

# publish and subscrib

# Singleton
